# The-Cancer-Feed
The Cancer Feed is a portal for learning about cancer.

The website was made for the Cancer unit of the Foundations of Science II course of Yale-NUS College. The task was to spread cancer awareness in some way.

The Cancer Feed uses Beautiful Soup for scraping the latest articles about cancer research from trustworthy institutions such as Cancer Research UK and The National Cancer Institute.

More about the Cancer Feed is available on the About page.
